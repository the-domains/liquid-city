Liquid City is a multi phase project investigating urban waterways by artist [Eve Mosher][0].

Phase One: Series of profiles of people shaping the future of the urban waterways. Geo-spatial and system maps of the NYC harbor and surrounding waterways. Database of resources related to the urban waterways and its infrastructure, transportation, ecology, recreation and commerce.

Phase Two: Creative engagement by myself and other artists using the online resource on the waterways. Projects will illuminate the opportunities and challenges of the NYC waterways.

Phase Three: A floating research vessel which brings together multi-disciplinary stakeholders for shared process, research and outcomes with an injection of cultural production.

Phase Four: The research vessel will sail The Great Loop on a multi-year journey to host stakeholders and cultural producers from other urban waterways.
